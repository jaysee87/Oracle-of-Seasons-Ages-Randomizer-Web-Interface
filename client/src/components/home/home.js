            <p>This site is simply an interface for the randomizer developed by Jangler. I take 0 credit in the actual programming of
              the randomizer. This site was designed to be user-friendly and to be a quick and efficient way to share seeds without having to post a rom anywhere or having each player generate the seed locally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: No roms are hosted or downloaded from this site. It merely serves a patch to make the randomized game and your browser applies the patch to your base rom on download.
